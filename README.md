# on-air

node script that switches a smart light (Wemo) on/off based on computer camera status

## TODO

- handle the case where the previously connected light is disconnected, to avoid calling on it
- error handling
- run at startup (https://github.com/jkeefe/wfh-on-air-light)
- console menu to choose the light from the list of devices (auto select if light and only one)
- learn typescript for reals :-)
